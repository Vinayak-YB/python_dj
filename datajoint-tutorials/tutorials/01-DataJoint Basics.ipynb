    ">* A data pipeline is a collection of processes and steps for organizing the data and computations. Data pipelines perform complex data acquisition sequences, processing, and analysis with integrated storage at each step. These steps may be thought of as nodes in a directed graph that defines their order of execution.\n",

    ">* The data pipeline is formed by making these tables interdependent (as the nodes are connected in a network). A **dependency** is a situation where a step of the data pipeline is dependent on a result from a sequentially previous step before it can complete its execution. A dependency graph forms an entire cohesive data pipeline. \n",
